This is a comprehensive tutorial on CoreMod, and a documentation of the process of developing CoreMod. Please selectively read the parts you need, of course, if you can have the patience to read all the content is of course the best.  

The original CoreMod section analyzes how FML injects code into Minecraft, and is not required reading; you can also read the FML CoreMod section directly from the version you want to develop.
